             </dev>
               <p>This is the Promethea Silk moth known as Callosamia Promethea or the spicebush silk moth. They are known 
                  as the spicebush silk moth because of their most common host plant, which is the spicebush or Lindera benzoin. 
                  The females tend to be more colorful than the males, as you can see below. This will make it easier for anyone 
                  who is looking for these moths because now they won’t have to guess which is a male or which is a female. </p>

               </dev>
               <p>
                  As the trend is seen throughout all of the moths that I have done so far, the person that names these moths (mostly Carl) 
                  loves Greek mythology and naming these moths after something that closely resembles them, making it a better cultural 
                  significance to some people but in some cultures certain colors of certain moths mean different things because in the 
                  regions that this moth is in the colors are just beautiful but in Greek mythology the meaning of this moth is Prometheus 
                  the trickster Titan and the god of fire. Prometheus was a great craftsman and was associated with the creation of mortals 
                  and was mainly associated with fire. Since he stole fire from Zeus himself, Zeus punished him, so when seeing classical 
                  paintings of this trickster, he has a deep red behind him, which is similar to the female moth’s color and why they are 
                  associated together. The other name of this moth is Callosami, which in Latin Callo means “beautiful,” and Sami was a water 
                  nymph in Greek mythology. Dru Drury named these beautiful creatures between 1770 – 1787 because of their beauty and that 
                  exact match to the classical paintings of the Titan Prometheus.

                  <h3>Where are they found</h3>
                </dev>
                <p>
                  These moths generally don’t have a specific place they like to stay because you can find these insects as far as 
                  southern parts of Canada all the way to eastern Texas. These moths love the woodlands, and seeing how the plants 
                  they love to feed on are all over those regions, they like to migrate to different places. There isn’t much on 
                  where they mate and where they like to primarily stay. But I did find it interesting that they like to stay on 
                  the East Coast of the US. The migration of these beautiful moths is dependent on the region, so on the southern 
                  end of the migration, the first generation of the moths tend to complete their life cycle in late spring, and then 
                  the second generation will then come and complete its life cycle. For most of the winter, these moths will end 
                  emerging after winter, going into spring in the northern region.

                </dev>
                <p>
                  The Promethea moth eats a plethora of foods like Wild Cherry, Tulip tree, Mongolia,  
                  White ash, lilac, and many more. Since these moths are another species of silk moths, 
                  they do not have developed mouthparts or a developed digestive system, which makes them 
                  unable to eat anything when they are larvae or caterpillars, they eat as much as they can 
                  before going into the cacoon, then they will become a pupa and emerge ready to mate. They can 
                  live up to two weeks.
