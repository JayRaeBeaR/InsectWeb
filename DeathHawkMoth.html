                </dev>
                  <p>These are the death hawk moths they are known for their skull that is on the top of the thorax. They are also well-known in the 
                    tattooing community because of their symbolism. Their symbolism is that they are an omen of death and mystery. The scientific of 
                    the Death Hawk Moth is <i>Acherontia Atropos</i>. This name is a part of the Greek mythology of the underworld.

                  <h3>Cultural/History Significants</h3>
                </dev>
                <p>In 1801, King George III was going into one of his fits of madness when they found two deathhead hawk moths in his bedroom. 
                  The scientific name Acherontia Atropos is part of Greek mythology of the underworld because Acheron is the name of the river 
                  that goes to Hades. The name Atropos is one of the three fates. Those ladies control human life but Atropos is the deity who 
                  cuts the thread of life. They named this moth the death head hawk moth because of the skull on the thorax. When talking about 
                  the symbolism of this moth is morality, the afterlife, and any other concept of life or death is known as a symbol of this moth. 
                  There is suspicion that the head on the moth evokes "memento mori". Memento mori is Latin for "Remember you will die". This goes 
                  back to Socrates who is an ancient philosopher who believed that proper philosophy is "about nothing else but dying and being dead". 
                  So when some people look at a deathhead hawk moth in a philosophical way. In the famous movie "The Silence of the Lamb", the death 
                  head hawk moth is used as a symbol of transformation from the killer Buffalo Bill. The reason he used them is because he was obsessed 
                  with the idea of changing his identity by taking specifically only women's skin to make his women's suit. In 1824, a letter was 
                  quoted from Germany that Death Head Hawk moths bring evil spirits that are man's enemy created in the dark that will fly into one's 
                  apartment to shine light on: war, hunger, and death to man or beast. </p>

                  <h3>How and Where they are found</h3>
                </dev>
                  <p>
                    They are found in parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia. As said in the cultural aspect they were found in Britain, where King George 
                    III resided, and Germany as well. They are more seen in Autumn and sometimes as late as November.

                  <h3>What They Eat</h3>
                </dev>
                  <p>
                    Since these moths are known for smelling like beeswax, so they tend to steal honey from beehives because they rather not gather 
                    their own (a little bit lazy but efficient right?!). When entering the hive, they use pheromones to allow them to not be attacked 
                    by the honey bees. However, the honey bees have developed a couple of defense mechanisms against these giant invaders. They will 
                    overheat them to the point where they are immobile, or they will suffocate them with the amount of heat they produce from forming 
                    a ball. Another defense mechanism they have is they will simply sting them until they die. There have been some studies where 
                    scientists believe that they make a high-pitched noise exactly like the queen bees, causing the bees to calm down and stop attacking 
                    them. However, when the moth drinks honey it cannot make that noise for up to 5 hours, so they will have to make a great escape if 
                    they do use that noise to help keep the bees off.
