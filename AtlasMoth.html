             </dev>
               <p>This is the atlas moth, one of the biggest moths in the world, seeing that their wingspan can get up to 14 inches. 
                  Another name for this big moth is <i>Attacus atlas </i>. When looking at this big moth, you would think nothing of 
                  it, but when it begins to open its wings, and you look closer, the wings look like snake heads, and that is one of 
                  the biggest defense mechanisms that this moth has against birds because the bird now thinks that hey those are 
                  snakes, not food. When looking at this month, you would think that the male is the one with more color and bigger, 
                  but you couldn’t be more wrong. The female is significantly bigger than the male since the wingspan of a female can 
                  be 240 – 250 mm wide, and a male’s wingspan can be from 210-230. Below there is a picture of the two:</p>

                  <h3>Cultural Significants</h3>
                </dev>
                <p>This month is known for its representation of strength and perseverance. The name Atlas comes from a Greek Titan 
                  named Atlas, who was known for holding the skies because he disobeyed different gods. Atlas himself was well-known 
                  as a wise man and a person who made astronomy. The symbolism of this moth can take many forms to many different 
                  people because the main symbolisms for this moth are strength, growth, evolution, and resilience. This moth itself 
                  is very big, and people see the size of this moth and moths in general as a big thing because, in the Chinese 
                  culture, they see moths as souls of their ancestors or souls of their loved ones. The main thing about this moth 
                  is the Greek mythology meaning of the size of this moth because it is so big they named it after the biggest Titan 
                  that holds the weight of the earth on his shoulders.</p>

                </dev>
                <p>These beautiful creatures are found in Southeast Asia because they are already acclimated to the temperature of 
                  the tropical and subtropical rainforests. Because they are so big, they do not have the energy to migrate, which 
                  is why you can only find them in southeastern Asia. They specifically stay near the Malay Archipelago, which is a 
                  Southeastern Asia island. </p>

                  <h3>What do they eat</h3>
                </dev>
                <p>
                  Since the older moths cannot eat, the caterpillars of the Atlas are the ones that harbor all the food and store it 
                  up for when they become adults. Again, like most silk moths, they cannot eat because of a lack of a digestive 
                  system and a lack of mouthparts. Since they cannot eat, they tend not to leave the place they hatch from because 
                  they don’t have enough energy to even move from the spot. Since they have the life stages of egg -> larva -> pupa -> adult, 
                  the pupa eats the most, and they usually eat woody stems, roots, and matured leaves, but they don’t necessarily 
                  like flowers. Since they cannot eat, their lifespan goes as long as 2 weeks, but since they lack mouth parts, they 
                  will preserve their energy for mostly mating.

                  <h3>How they got their name</h3>
                </dev>
                <p>
                  n Cantonese culture, they are the “Snakehead moth” specifically because when they open up their wings, that is how 
                  they protect themselves because the predators will then think that the moth is a two-headed cobra. Now, many 
                  scientists don’t like this because they don’t believe that is why they got their names sometimes, but Carl 
                  Linnaeus did name this moth in 1758. Originally, Carl named these moths after the Titan Atlas because, again, of 
                  their very large size. They are known for being the third biggest moth in the world.
