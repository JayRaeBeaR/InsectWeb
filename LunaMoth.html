               <p>
                  This is the luna moth also known as <i>Actias luna</i>. They are light green silk moths. There are a few characteristics 
                  that can distinguish the male from the female. Males are going to be a lighter shade of green and somewhat smaller than 
                  the females. The females have thinner antennae and the males have that fan like antennae as seen below:

                  <h3>Cultural Significants</h3>
               </dev>
               <p>Another name for this moth is the African Moon Moth, and it is believed to manifest rebirth, new beginnings, and 
                  return to the light. The return to the light is more because these moths are so attracted to bright lights at night 
                  that they are, in a sense, returning to the daylight at night. Some people connect these beautiful creatures to the heart 
                  chakra. The heart chakra is more of a Hinduism practice, but many cultures like Native Americans, Celtic, and Romans believe 
                  in this moth to be a spiritual being or sign of some sort. When taking a closer look into the heart chakra, it is meant for 
                  guidance and intuition. I have read many blogs, and many people always state that seeing a moth, especially one as rare as a 
                  luna moth, means a very special thing is going to happen because you don't always see these moths, and when you do, it means 
                  something important. In Roman mythology, the Great Mother Goddess or Cybele is, in some cultures, connected to the Luna moth. 
                  The Great Mother Goddess was known for not only her motherhood but her parenting to gods, humans, and beasts. Another god that 
                  this moth is connected to is the goddess of the moon in Greek mythology, Selene. Her parents were the Titans Hyperion and Theia. 
                  She was known as this kind and beautiful goddess. The moon, in most ancient beliefs, was the most sacred thing because the 
                  phases always meant different things like rebirth and death, and sometimes women would be so connected to the moon because 
                  they would associate it with their menstrual cycle. In Celtic and Native American folklore, they both similarly believe that 
                  if they see this moth, they will think of it as a sign of rebirth and a spiritual/magical thing. A lot of people believed 
                  this of these moths because they are so beautiful, like butterflies themselves, but they are instead moths that are just as 
                  beautiful but rare than them. </p>

                  <h3>Where are they found</h3>
               </dev>
               <p>These beautiful creatures, even though they have short life spans, can be found primarily in North America. They are quite 
                  the travelers, honestly. Specifically, they travel from Saskatchewan, Canada, to Texas, then to Nova Scotia, Canada, to 
                  Florida. When looking for them, you will find them in woodland areas more. Depending on where they breed, how many generations 
                  you will see per year. So, in Louisiana, they have experienced Luna Moths each month of the year. In the deep South, they have 
                  three gens in a single year from March to September. Through the Ohio River Valley, they produce two generations, and in Canada, 
                  they only produce one generation. This is called a brood, and it’s only through May through July. </p>

                  <h3>Where they got their name</h3>
               </dev>
               <p>They got their name from Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The reason he named the luna moths well, “luna moths” 
                  was because he noticed the moon-like shape on their wings and referred it to the Roman goddess as well.  
                  While their wings do look like moons, it helps them immensely from predators like bats because it distorts 
                  their echolocation, allowing the moths to make an escape.

                  <h3>What do they eat</h3>
               </dev>
               <p>Technically, only the caterpillars of the Luna moth can eat because the adult Luna moths like most worms have 
                  reduced mouth parts so which means they cannot eat. The caterpillars however can eat walnuts, hickories, pecans, 
                  persimmon, sweet gum, and sumacs. The adults also don’t have a digestive system making them unable to even consume 
                  food if they wanted to. </p>
